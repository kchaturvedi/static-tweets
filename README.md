This is a demo project for creating statically-rendered tweets using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Twitter's API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index).

For more details, follow along in the corresponding blog post [here](https://ikartik.co/code/static-tweets).

## Getting Started

First, you will need to set up a Twitter developer account and obtain API credentials at [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/).
Then, set up a Bearer token as an environment variable named `TWITTER_TOKEN`. The code will reference this variable to fetch tweet data.

Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the demo.
